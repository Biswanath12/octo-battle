> A battle game with octocats.

## How to play

There are two armies: red and blue. Each army has the following units (10 of each type): *murakami*, *miner* and *mega*.

There is no much to do in this game. Just keep pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> to continue the battle. Everything is pretty random.

**Why**: I developed this small game when I was in college to demonstrate how *classes* work in JavaScript. :dizzy:
